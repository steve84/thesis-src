Pretty much what you see is what you get and is being sold AS IS. I am no expert in gaming systems so have no way to test to see if this works. as you can see from the pics it does turn on but i don't have a controller to do any futher testing. the power cord i had from a word radio that i am keeping but the hdmi cable i will throw in. also in the from there is a cover missing which is in the pic that also shows where the hard drive i guess goes. when i pulled out the tray i noticed it had a 320gb hard drive in it. the money from this auction goes into fixing the damages to the rental unit.</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>2</td><td>114.51</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDcyMA==/z/TpsAAOxyc2pTXzU5/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDcyMA==/z/duEAAOxyeglTXzVD/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDcyMA==/z/PwIAAOxyi-ZTXzWN/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>221429979322</td><td>Sony Playstation 3 PS3 Piano Black Console 80GB</td><td>Playstation 3 works awesome, but recently the disc drive went out and no longer reads blu ray's, dvd's or games.

This gaming set has honestly been used ONLY OCCASIONALLY (1-2 times each week) since I purchased it a couple years ago and that's it, as it is in EXCELLENT MINT condition! It has ALWAYS been in a smoke-free environment 100% of the time and was never used to play blu-ray movies, stream video, play music, etc. so the running time on this console is VERY LOW. It was ONLY used for gaming purposes and even that was very minimal. Since I started medical school, I just have not had the time to use this gaming console at all so I am reluctantly letting it go. I bought this gaming set at the mall for $430.00 at the time and it comes with EVERYTHING it originally came with when I had purchased it. The ORIGINAL OEM cables, instruction manuals, etc. are all included and some of those items were never even used or opened. The gaming console includes the original Sony OEM black controller which does not work anymore and can be used for parts. It does, however, also include an original Sony OEM red controller which I purchased additionally for $50 that is in GREAT condition and has NOTHING wrong with it. There is NO MINIMUM RESERVE on this auction so here is your chance at a great deal from a RELIABLE seller with great feedback! Shipping and handling will be $26.95 via USPS EXPEDITED shipping.

During the recent software update one of the controllers tends to jitter on the screen during games so all I do is turn the controller off and then back on and it works fine again, but I wanted to point this out. From the pictures the console seems dusty, but I assure you it will be clean upon receiving it. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen.

About 6 months ago a disk got put in crooked and it got stuck so I took it apart to get the disk out. It all works perfectly after the repair.There is one tiny blemish on the top that is so small it is a little hard to see. Also, the shiny clear plastic below where you put disks in has a small crack. You can see both these in the pictures. Really this unit is in excellent shape with very light use.

I bought it about 8 months ago because I had encountered a problem with the video card in my PS3 Slim. The fat consoles, like this one, seem to be able to avoid that problem because the CPU that controls the fan prefers to keep the console cool. This helps preserve the console and make sure it works properly, at the expense of a little added noise. Anyway, like I was saying, I have never had a problem with this console and I probably played it for about 8 hours on an occasion or two, needless to say, it performed great. The only reason I am selling it is because I need extra money for my car and I am also getting a little old for video games. Upon purchase I will ship the console, 2 controllers (the black one has a loose joystick cover), an extra long charging cable, the power cord and an HDMI cord.Thank you for viewing my item for sale and good luck bidding for it!</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>2</td><td>120.0</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NTA=/z/sS8AAMXQrhdTXZjJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDEwMDA=/z/e0sAAOxy7nNTXZE~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NTA=/z/WbYAAOxyHIlTXZFF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>257</td><td>151289468799</td><td>Sony Playstation PS vita 3G Wi Fi PCH 1101</td><td>Sony playstation vita 3G/wi-fi model PCH 1101 has been tested and works as it should.The overall cosmetic condition is with minor light to moderate scratches and scuffs marks on screen and also rear touch panel.Please view photos for more details on the cosmetic condition.Vita and USB sync cable are the only two items up for the sale.Does not includes memory card or game cartridges or any other accessories.Any questions please ask.

This is a BRAND NEW, unused REPLACEMENT console sent by Sony (as covered by the manufacturer's warranty) after they deemed my original console to be defective beyond repair. Everything except the console itself was VERY lightly used during the time the original console was in use. The console itself has only been turned on by me ONCE to test and ensure it was in perfect working order. You are basically receiving a brand new system that is STILL under Manufacturer's Warranty. The original console was purchased from Best Buy on release day so the warranty runs through a year from then.

Works great, and the system is in really great condition (no controllers or Cables included). 30 day warranty included!!! If you get YLOD, return it to me, and I'll fix it for free! *Does not extend to Blu Ray drive or other components* This PS3 was professionally reballed by me, which means that the crappy lead-free solder that fastens the RSX GPU chip to the motherboard was removed, and the solder was replaced with fresh leaded solder. I also replaced all of the dried-up old thermal paste that was put there by Sony. Theoretically, this machine should be more robust than an brand new one. Research this for yourself if you don't believe me. This PS3 runs nice and cool, and quiet. Tech details:PS3 CECHH01Sony Official Firmware 3.5580GB Hard Drive.Professionally Reballed the RSX GPU.The original heat-sink compound was removed and replaced.

What's included?PS3 CECHH01 Console80GB Hard Drive30 day YLOD warranty I cannot offer refunds on these used consoles. I do guarantee them against DOA, which means that if it does not work the first time you try it, right after you unpack it, I will fix it or replace it. It's not new, and even brand new PS3s fail, because they have multiple design flaws that i have no control over. If it gets YLOD within a 30 day period, I will fix it for free (You pay for shipping both ways). Other hardware issues are covered by my DOA policy, but not the warranty. Outside of that warranty period, I will happily fix problems for you at my normal repair rate.

The matte black finish on the grooved panel running across the top of the console reminds us of the Atari 2600, while the top loading disc drive brings back memories of playing Sonic CD on the redesigned Sega CD in the early 90s.Weighing just 4.6lb (2.1kg), the Super Slim is three pounds lighter than the PS3 Slim and is approximately 20 percent smaller and thinner than previous models, measuring 11.4"  2.3"  9" (29  6  23 cm). The sleek curved frame, small size and lightweight doesnt make any difference to the performance of the new console (unless youre planning on moving your PS3 around frequently), but if you have limited space in your T.V. cabinet, it does fit quite snugly among your other devices without taking up too much space.The major design change comes courtesy of the Blu-ray drive. The grooved central panel on top of the console, which is encased top and bottom by the familiar dust-collecting glossy black plastic styling of previous models, isn't just part of the new aesthetic. In this latest revision, you have to physically place the disc into the Blu-ray drive and then manually slide the loading tray from right to left to close it, so the ridges give your fingertips something to grasp as you close the panel.Though we like the overall design, the build quality of the loading panel doesnt instil us with confidence as the plastic sliding panel is quite thin and flimsy; we do worry that it will break over long term use, or if we close it too vigorously. Manually having to close the panel feels a little bit awkward and clunky too when compared to the way you simply tease the mouth of other PS3 models with your game disc and watch it smoothly swallow it up. Elsewhere, all the main features on the PS3 are present, including the AC adaptor port, Optical out, RCA, Ethernet and HDMI slots on the rear of the console, as well an air vent that to ensure it doesnt overheat. On the front panel are two USB ports on the bottom left-hand side, and the on/off switch on the right, which lights up either green or red depending on its current status. Theres a small design change on the front panel as the on/off switch now sits on a slightly protruding toggle bar measuring around six inches. Pressing the right hand-side of that bar turns the console on and off and pressing the left-hand side opens up the disc-loading tray, though this can also be done manually.In the box, you get the wireless DualShock 3 controller and charging cable, a composite A/V cable and power cable. Once again, the bundle disappointingly doesnt include a HDMI cable which youll have to buy separately if you want to get the most out of the 1080p/1080i/720p display. The Superslim is said to produce less power than previous models, with a 190W power supply replacing the 250W supply of the most recent Slim models, but internally you still have the same RSX GPU drive and 45nm Cell processor. The Superslim currently comes with a hefty 500GB harddrive, which is a good size for storing lots of data. In terms of performance, there doesnt appear to be any difference between the Superslim and the previous models as loading times are identical. However, it is noticeably quieter than any previous SKU with very quiet whirring sounds even when you first load a disc</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>4</td><td>180.0</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODIyWDYwMA==/z/eSsAAOxy0bRTFKjU/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/7QAAAOxy0x1TWbPX/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/USoAAOxyUylTWbPY/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>359</td><td>321387570268</td><td>Sony PlayStation 4 (Latest Model)- 500 GB Jet Black Console (As Is Broken)</td><td>Posted with eBay Mobile</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>1</td><td>142.5</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzNlg2NDA=/z/8fYAAOxy7nNTQyJm/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzNlg2NDA=/z/VoIAAMXQ74JTQyJn/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzNlg2NDA=/z/7fUAAOxyaTxTQyCo/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>360</td><td>151289517328</td><td>Sony PlayStation 2 Slim Charcoal Black Console (PAL - SCPH-90004CB)</td><td>This is a used PS2 Slim.

We diagnose units as well and thoroughly as possible and our diagnoses are typically correct. We do not show ESNs or IMEIs in the listings because they are guaranteed to be clear. Accessories included with items may not be OEM. Also, due to the nature of used electronic devices, we cannot guarantee battery life. Return Policy Please read carefully: We have a 30 day warranty on all USED items, that the item is as described in the listing above. Items must be returned in the condition in which they were sold, so this warranty does not cover damage caused by customer misuse or neglect. After 30 days, we are no longer able to accept a return.

Returns sent back at your own expense cannot be reimbursed. Please include RMA number and eBay name in return package for faster processing. 3. To return non-defective items, a 15% restocking fee will apply. Electronics cannot be returned due to carrier incompatibility or physical condition. Some phones require that you have a data plan; we do not allow returns due to incompatibility with your plan, please check with your carrier before bidding. The item must be returned in the same condition as how it was received including all accessories and packing materials. If any item is missing from the original package a fee will be applied for the cost of the replacement. Contact us for an RMA number, we are not responsible for returns sent without our prior knowledge. 4.

If a question is asked that is answered either here or within the listing, we may not respond to your inquiry. Thank you. Q: Has my item been shipped yet? A: We ship items on the next applicable business day after payment. We ship 5 days a week, Monday through Friday. If you order and pay for an item on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or during a holiday your item will not ship out until the following Monday or business day. Please see the Payment & Shipping tab for more information. Q: Do you ship internationally? A: We do not ship internationally at this time. Q: When will I receive my refund? A: It typically takes 1 to 5 business days for us to check in, process, and test your return, depending on our amount of inbound shipments. If it has been more than 5 days since the tracking shows that we received your return, please contact us. Q: Can you go any lower on this phone? / Will you accept an offer? A: The prices that we have listed are the lowest that we can offer at this time. Q: Does this phone come with a charger? A: The listing description will display all of the accessories that are included or not included with that item. Q: Is this phone unlocked? A: Devices are locked to the wireless carrier listed in the title, unless it explicitly states that they are unlocked. We do not support the process of unlocking and will not be able to accept a return for the inability to unlock a device. Q: I live close by, can I come pick it up? A: We are not offering local pickup as a shipping option and have no plans to do so in the future. Q: Do you include an invoice in the package? A: In an effort to remain green, we do not include paper invoices with our shipments. Q: Is this a picture of the actual phone? Can you email me more pictures? A: Due to the large amount of devices we process on a daily basis, it is logistically impossible to photograph every single device. You will either receive the device from the photograph or one of very similar condition. We try to be as objective as possible when listing our items and describing the condition, so that you may feel comfortable knowing what you are purchasing. Q: Can you send me the ESN? Is the ESN clean? A: We do not give out ESN numbers. We verify and guarantee that all of our ESN's & IMEI numbers are clean and ready to be activated with the listed carrier. We stand by them 100%, and if for any reason the carrier will not activate the item, we will give you a full refund. Q: Why do you charge sales tax in so many states? A: Our parent company has nexus in all 50 states, so we are required to charge sales tax everywhere, not just in our home state of Texas. Helpful Links More Items!

It fit's perfectly so I'm very happy that I didn't size it. Super sparkly...Thank you very much. Right before christmas of 2009 my entire house burnt down. I was never able to replace any of my jewelry. Now I'm divorcing so I really miss having diamond rings. My wedding bands were platinum with princess cut diamonds so I figured I'd celebrate the divorce with something different.. lol!!! wooo hooo!!! I have to be honest, I won't go to another jeweler now. You have responded immediately to any questions that I have asked and offered above and beyond services and quality fine jewelry at low cost.. The ring that I received looks brand new without a scratch on it. I'm super impressed. So impressed that there is actually another ring that I have my eye on. You have three of this same style, but must have some differences because they come in at different price points and sizes. It's two toned gold, diamond round and baguette band. The band crosses over in the front in a twist T shape almost. Sarah - sarahjerry1101 I hope you don't mind me taking up a few minutes of your time, but I really wanted to let you know ,I was nervous when I purchased the ring from you .I went to get my mother a mothers ring and asked my jeweler to appraise the ring I purchased from you and was SHOCKED . I am proudly wearing a EXQUISITE DIAMOND and when I'm ready for another I will purchase from you knowing I will receive quality in beauty of the diamonds you offer, I wanted to highly commend you !!!! Thanks for this smile I'm wearing everyday with this ring.jalinda2011( 50) I just wanted to thank you for your quick resizing and delivery of the ring I purchased. I cannot tell you how delighted I am with my right hand ring and everyone I show it to is VERY impressed with it's beauty , sparkle, and quality. Your work and merchandise is superb and I plan to purchase diamond jewelry from only you in the future! Again, a heart felt Thank YOU!!! - kmscott1955 Just a quick note to thank you for the manner in which you conduct business.

My trust in doing business with you was well placed and I will come to you for my future jewelry purchases again and again. It was a pleasure to work with you. I appreciate your professionalism and top notch customer service!! tamaroo22 ( 194)Just wanted to send a qiuck note to say, Thank You, very much. Your company is one of the best if not the best on E-Bay. I have already recieved one ring, your shipping and expertise should be cloned. Absolutely the best I have encountered on E-Bay!!! I know I will be purchasing more jewelry from you in the future. I will probably check your store first before going anywhere else. Thanks again and look forward to transactions in the future. You have a fantastic collection of jewelry. Respectfully, Joe Amentolajaajnh8yfc( 80) We received our ring today and we're very pleased. Steve and I have waited all our lives to find one another (we're alittle older than the typical couple) and we thank you for having the perfect ring that was in our budget. It's beautiful and we intend to recommend you to our friends and family. Along with that, your answering all our questions put us at ease about buying a diamond on line. Great work!!!Yours truly, Laurie and Stevenlgmazzarella( 11) hi, i just wanted to tell you that i went to the filenes basement store in manhasset long island and they hd this ring there for 4650.00. you cant imagine how good that made me feel about this ring. there jewelry is advertised as 80% below retail. so my god this was the best deal ever for a piece of jewelry on ebay ever and i will definitely be back for more. just need to save some money. love you guys. sincerely, karen - hambrecht123Hello, I would like to say thank you very much for the jewelry pieces that I have bought from you. I purchased four pieces recently and they have all been exactly what they were described as. I have dealt with a few not so very honest people on ebay before. It is nice to finally deal with a seller that is honest w/their descriptions of the items. I do say that it is a pleasure to purchase from you and I know that if I buy something from rjjewelry, that I will get exactly what is described. When I purchase from you, I don't worry about my purchase. Thank you so much.mistyrae1( 19)I just had to tell you my opinion about this bracelet before I left feedback. There's never enough room to say anything on those feedback strips. Anyway, I am stunned at the beauty of this bracelet! What prompted me to bid on this was your detailed photos of this item. It is just as gorgeous as depicted on your site. I have now become an rjjewelry4 customer convert! If all your jewelry items are this fabulous, I'm making you my ONLY jewelry seller! Make no mistake, I will be purchasing other pieces from your site. Thank you for being such an honest seller with classy integrity--you're what E-bay is all about!yorkpenguin7Hi! I hope you don't mind me taking up a few minutes of your time, but I really wanted to write you this note. I have purchased quite a number of your diamond rings in this past few weeks. I have also purchased several from other buyers. I wanted to highly commend you on the quality, the accuracy of the items you offer, the beauty of the diamonds and their settings. What I see is exactly what I get! And what I get is EXQUISITE DIAMOND RINGS!!! What I have gotten from others is a travesty to eBay and to those buying diamonds. I don't normally return items, but what I have gotten from other Sellers has been extremely disappointing, misrepresented etc. and will be returned. I just thought that I should tell you how extremely grateful I am for a Seller who has as much integrity as your company. I will certainly buy from you from now on! You're definitely a 100% CLASS ACT!! I would not hesitate to buy any product from you In fact you're the only company I will deal with in the future. What I see is what I get, and more! I'm totally awed by each new piece of jewelry I receive!! I wish all eBay Sellers were as honest and forthcoming with their products, as your company! Again, Thank you so much!! Sandy (beachlover147) I just wanted to tell you that I am near speachless. When I opened the package and saw my new wedding ring, I actually cried. There are no words to express the beauty and quality of this ring, I am so thankful! My original wedding ring was stolen from me, and I was so upset. My husband told me to try and find a replacement. I had purchased another diamond wedding ring from another jeweler on Ebay but it was not the quality that was stated and I had to return it. This ring is more than I expected and I am so very happy with it! The sizing you did was perfect and the shipping was so fast!! You haven't seen the last of me, you have earned my complete trust and confidence!! I thank you from the bottom of my heart!! God Bless! Angel (*ivory-angel*) Just got the ring!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! Shipping was amazingly fast!!! And the quality of the ring...oh...I am speechless!!! Better than perfect! I could never buy such good quality ring for that price at ANY jewelry store. How do you do that?! You guys ARE the BEST!!!! My boyfriend will love this ring! THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!! ibron13GREAT FEEDBACKS FROM HAPPY CUSTOMERS WOW!!!!

The matte black finish on the grooved panel running across the top of the console reminds us of the Atari 2600, while the top loading disc drive brings back memories of playing Sonic CD on the redesigned Sega CD in the early 90s.Weighing just 4.6lb (2.1kg), the Super Slim is three pounds lighter than the PS3 Slim and is approximately 20 percent smaller and thinner than previous models, measuring 11.4"  2.3"  9" (29  6  23 cm). The sleek curved frame, small size and lightweight doesnt make any difference to the performance of the new console (unless youre planning on moving your PS3 around frequently), but if you have limited space in your T.V. cabinet, it does fit quite snugly among your other devices without taking up too much space.The major design change comes courtesy of the Blu-ray drive. The grooved central panel on top of the console, which is encased top and bottom by the familiar dust-collecting glossy black plastic styling of previous models, isn't just part of the new aesthetic. In this latest revision, you have to physically place the disc into the Blu-ray drive and then manually slide the loading tray from right to left to close it, so the ridges give your fingertips something to grasp as you close the panel.Though we like the overall design, the build quality of the loading panel doesnt instil us with confidence as the plastic sliding panel is quite thin and flimsy; we do worry that it will break over long term use, or if we close it too vigorously. Manually having to close the panel feels a little bit awkward and clunky too when compared to the way you simply tease the mouth of other PS3 models with your game disc and watch it smoothly swallow it up. Elsewhere, all the main features on the PS3 are present, including the AC adaptor port, Optical out, RCA, Ethernet and HDMI slots on the rear of the console, as well an air vent that to ensure it doesnt overheat. On the front panel are two USB ports on the bottom left-hand side, and the on/off switch on the right, which lights up either green or red depending on its current status. Theres a small design change on the front panel as the on/off switch now sits on a slightly protruding toggle bar measuring around six inches. Pressing the right hand-side of that bar turns the console on and off and pressing the left-hand side opens up the disc-loading tray, though this can also be done manually.In the box, you get the wireless DualShock 3 controller and charging cable, a composite A/V cable and power cable. Once again, the bundle disappointingly doesnt include a HDMI cable which youll have to buy separately if you want to get the most out of the 1080p/1080i/720p display. The Superslim is said to produce less power than previous models, with a 190W power supply replacing the 250W supply of the most recent Slim models, but internally you still have the same RSX GPU drive and 45nm Cell processor. The Superslim currently comes with a hefty 500GB harddrive, which is a good size for storing lots of data. In terms of performance, there doesnt appear to be any difference between the Superslim and the previous models as loading times are identical. However, it is noticeably quieter than any previous SKU with very quiet whirring sounds even when you first load a disc</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>4</td><td>145.35</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODIyWDYwMA==/z/eSsAAOxy0bRTFKjU/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/7QAAAOxy0x1TWbPX/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/USoAAOxyUylTWbPY/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>427</td><td>151285799113</td><td>Sony PlayStation 2 Slim Satin Silver Console (NTSC - SCPH-77001SS)</td><td>Comes with over 10 games a memory 8mb memory card and a controller.contact me I have three grand theft auto games.vice city,gta 3,gta San Andreas.those game are extra</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>2</td><td>25.0</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY0WDEwMjQ=/z/~UUAAOxyBjBTVw9F/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3MFgxMDI0/z/f-cAAMXQrhdTVw-d/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3MFgxMDI0/z/AYQAAMXQyY1TVxJ2/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>428</td><td>261460502959</td><td>Sony PlayStation 2 Black Console (NTSC - SCPH-50001)</td><td>Unit powers on but gets a disk read error.

If you need to return the item for reasons other than a defective item or inaccuracies in the description the buyer must pay all shipping costs. ABOUT US We desire to provide quality items and great service. We rarely set reserve prices, we let the market do that; and we try to keep shipping/handling prices to a minimum by using recycled materials. Also, check out our buyer feedback, for we think it speaks for itself. Thank you for your bids and we hope to have your business again in the future. NOTE ABOUT FEEDBACK: When you receive your item please remember to leave positive feedback with 5 stars. If there are problems please communicate those right away and we will do our best to fix it if we can. PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS & OTHER STUFF Feel free to e-mail us if you have any additional questions. The shipping calculator is available to provide approximate shipping costs. We ship via FedEx because it is generally the cheapest shipping carrier, so it is possible that your shipping cost will be cheaper at the close of the auction. Larger items are more difficult to get right with the shipping calculator, but we will do our best. All domestic shipments will be made via FedEx. The USPS is a nightmare to deal with if the package is ever lost or damaged. Shipping insurance will automatically be provided on all domestic shipments with FedEx. If you only have a PO Box we can ship via USPS but it will generally be more expensive. We will only ship international shipments via USPS Priority International or International Express, and we do not alter customs forms. We have tons of stuff which we add frequently, so keep coming back to check our auctions. We will be glad to combine shipping if you win multiple items. Above all, we want to work with buyers and provide quick and fair customer service, so please contact us if you are unhappy with your purchase. AFTER THE AUCTION: If the auction does not have a flat postage fee, send us your shipping address during this time and we will find out the shipping costs for your items. Once that is complete, we will send you an invoice with the total costs. If you are bidding on multiple items and want to combine shipping also let us know during this time.

The sleek curved frame, small size and lightweight doesnt make any difference to the performance of the new console (unless youre planning on moving your PS3 around frequently), but if you have limited space in your T.V. cabinet, it does fit quite snugly among your other devices without taking up too much space.The major design change comes courtesy of the Blu-ray drive. The grooved central panel on top of the console, which is encased top and bottom by the familiar dust-collecting glossy black plastic styling of previous models, isn't just part of the new aesthetic. In this latest revision, you have to physically place the disc into the Blu-ray drive and then manually slide the loading tray from right to left to close it, so the ridges give your fingertips something to grasp as you close the panel.Though we like the overall design, the build quality of the loading panel doesnt instil us with confidence as the plastic sliding panel is quite thin and flimsy; we do worry that it will break over long term use, or if we close it too vigorously. Manually having to close the panel feels a little bit awkward and clunky too when compared to the way you simply tease the mouth of other PS3 models with your game disc and watch it smoothly swallow it up. Elsewhere, all the main features on the PS3 are present, including the AC adaptor port, Optical out, RCA, Ethernet and HDMI slots on the rear of the console, as well an air vent that to ensure it doesnt overheat. On the front panel are two USB ports on the bottom left-hand side, and the on/off switch on the right, which lights up either green or red depending on its current status. Theres a small design change on the front panel as the on/off switch now sits on a slightly protruding toggle bar measuring around six inches. Pressing the right hand-side of that bar turns the console on and off and pressing the left-hand side opens up the disc-loading tray, though this can also be done manually.In the box, you get the wireless DualShock 3 controller and charging cable, a composite A/V cable and power cable. Once again, the bundle disappointingly doesnt include a HDMI cable which youll have to buy separately if you want to get the most out of the 1080p/1080i/720p display. The Superslim is said to produce less power than previous models, with a 190W power supply replacing the 250W supply of the most recent Slim models, but internally you still have the same RSX GPU drive and 45nm Cell processor. The Superslim currently comes with a hefty 250GB harddrive, which is a good size for storing lots of data. In terms of performance, there doesnt appear to be any difference between the Superslim and the previous models as loading times are identical. However, it is noticeably quieter than any previous SKU with very quiet whirring sounds even when you first load a disc</td><td>Video Games & Consoles:Video Game Consoles</td><td>4</td><td>177.5</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODIyWDYwMA==/z/eSsAAOxy0bRTFKjU/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/HTMAAOxyBjBTWa8v/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/HB0AAMXQ74JTWa8x/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>488</td><td>301165369292</td><td>Sony PlayStation 4 (Latest Model)- 500 GB Jet Black Console</td><td>Like new ps4 bundle with one controler and head set with nba 2k14 Digital copy.

PS3 / Playstation3 / Playstation 3 / Sony Playstation / Model CECH-250A1 Product DescriptionThe Sony PlayStation 3 offers unified online gaming, access to the PlayStation Network, multimedia capabilities, and a Blu-ray disc player. At 160 GB of storage, the PS3 Slim provides ample memory for a player's favorite games and movies. With its slender design, which makes it significantly light and small, the PlayStation 3 offers a streamlined look and runs quietly, making it a suitable addition to any home. The unit's strong graphics processing by the NVIDIA RSX Reality Synthesizer can output resolutions from 480i/576i SD up to 1080p HD.
