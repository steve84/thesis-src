The Fine Print I have set my auctions to the lowest possible shipping rate that will cover the postage, packing materials, and the fee that is charged in the final listing fees. I have set to combine at $.50 each additional though some additional shipping costs may occur (depending on location). I recently found that there is a fee in the final listing fees for shipping. No matter what the value is of any car, the starting bid is always $.99. A lot of my cars sell well under the actual value and quite a few never get above or very far over the starting bid. For this reason I am being forced to raise the shipping cost in order to offset said fees. I always do my best to ship in a new, sturdy box with one half inch bubble wrap to insure that the cars (and the cards that most of them are on) arrive in the condition of which they were listed. I sincerely apologize for the rise in shipping costs and promise to keep it to a minimum. I got into this to buy and thank sell cars that my sons and I enjoy so much, not to take your money with inflated shipping costs.

OK ok, so it's not in perfect condition but hey, this is from 2004! Smoke free home means it won't stink like an old ashtray when you get it. Still feel free to make it smell like anything you like once you own it. The price is FLEXIBLE. Make an offer if you'd like to try for a lower price. Shipping is NOT negotiable. My combined shipping is fair. If you plan to negative or low star me over shipping, PLEASE find another seller. All my packaged diecast cars will ship in a box. That's right, a nice sturdy box to keep you new treasure safe until it arrives to you. Of course I have no control over what the postman does with the package once it's out of my hands BUT I can tell you, some sellers ship in envelopes. Which is sure to arrive damaged. Anyway, my shipping is not that expensive considering I do use good packing materials. Depending on the item, it can be packing peanuts, foam sheeting, bubble wrap of a combination of these. I ship FAST. The only exception is days I might be out of town. These are shown as "vacation settings" that say the seller is away. If you see this, then check out my store as it will clearly display when I plan to return. OR write and you'll receive an instant out of office response. Yes, I combine shipping. Most items are set up to have your multiple item show the combined discount. If it doesn't just send a message and I'll send a combined invoice. No discounts after you've paid. EBay requires me to mail each item as it's paid for. USPS 1st class is limited to 13 ounces. Often I can get 3 HW's maybe 4 if the new plastic bodies before it has to go USPS Priority mail. While you can fool the eBay system and have your cars go 1st class (try it if you don't believe me) the combined invoices I create will show the shipping method. Yes I ship international. HOWEVER I use the eBay Global Shipping Program. Which means I send your package to an eBay location in the United States and they forward it to you. I have NO CONTROL over what eBay charges you for this service. I know it's a lot because I've heard from buyers. Sorry there is nothing I can do to change what eBay charges for Global shipping. I can only suggest you contact eBay directly OH and before I forget, please pay quickly. EBay has a new policy that can keep some items available to other buyers until it's paid for. So if you want this, pay for it quickly. If you want a number of my items, put them in your shopping cart to pay all at once. Have questions? PLEASE write.Thanks for stopping by. Please check out my other items. You can search by keyword in my store!! &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;div style="text-align:center"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://ti2.auctiva.com/sw/java.gif" border="0"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;table align="center"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;tr&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;td&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://emporium.auctiva.com/lwr-2008" target="_blank"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://ti2.auctiva.com/sw/browse1.gif" border="0"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/td&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;td height="23px" valign="middle" align="center"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;font face="arial" size="2"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;b&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://emporium.auctiva.com/lwr-2008" target="_blank"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;lwr-2008&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Store&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/b&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/td&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/tr&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/table&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://ti2.auctiva.com/web/aswCredit.gif" border="0"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://www.auctiva.com/?how=scLnk2" target="_blank"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://ti2.auctiva.com/images/sc1line2.gif" border="0"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;div style="text-align:center"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://mostpopular.sellathon.com/?id=AC444065"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://www.sellathon.com/Resources/Images/countercredit.gif" border="0"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</td><td>Toys & Hobbies:Diecast & Toy Vehicles:Cars, Trucks & Vans:Diecast-Modern Manufacture</td><td>2</td><td>9.88</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTk5WDEwMjk=/z/XwcAAOxyyrRR-gHi/$T2eC16Z,!ygE9s7HJ+DgBR-gHhsu,!~~60_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI2MFg5NTc=/z/XucAAOxyyrRR-gHW/$(KGrHqV,!pEFHo9(-GhzBR-gHW,KPw~~60_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFg5OTk=/z/L6IAAOxyldpR-gHe/$(KGrHqR,!o4FHvumeMKwBR-gHd1c+g~~60_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>283</td><td>131178192873</td><td>Hot Wheels, 2014, '67 Ford Mustang Coupe, HW City Series</td><td>You are bidding on a Hot wheels, 2014, '67 Ford Mustang Coupe, HW City series, please use photo for condition or please contact me though ebay. if you have any further ?'s.

Thank you for checking out our item ~ ask questions you may have pertaining to this item PRIOR to bidding please. L@@K at photos!! !!!!!!*********************!!!!!!****************************!!!!!*******************************!!!!! What you see in the photo is exactly what you are bidding on. If you are new to EBay, please ask questions and ALWAYS give sellers the opportunity to address any issues you may have (with an item you won from their auction) prior to leaving neutral or negative feedback. Most sellers block new bidders for not being educated on EBay etiquette. We do not want to do that, so let us work with you. COMBINED SHIPPING: Items must be totaled & paid for with one invoice. Once you are done bidding/buying, I will send you an invoice. Otherwise, normal per item shipping and handling charges will apply to each individual item. Also, I make no money on shipping. I charge you what I am charged, if there is a difference, you will most likely receive a refund from me. READ ITEM DESCRIPTIONS CAREFULLY: I describe what I see and what I know about the item based on my information and research. I do not claim to be an expert. You need to be the expert on the items you are bidding on. Ask questions and know that all sales are final. MISC Disclaimers: If you won an item, you must pay for the item. If payment is not received in 10 days, on the 11th day an unpaid dispute will be started. If insurance was not paid for on an item, the item will be sent without insurance and if broken or damaged in shipping, there is nothing I will be able to do as I have already done my part. AGAIN, always contact the seller prior to leaving negative or neutral feedback.</td><td>Toys & Hobbies:Diecast & Toy Vehicles:Cars, Trucks & Vans:Diecast-Modern Manufacture</td><td>2</td><td>4.99</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3NoAAOxyRhBS8DiK/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2lwAAOxy63FS8DiR/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x0EAAMXQlgtS8DiZ/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>351</td><td>321389201248</td><td>HOT WHEELS LOOSE 2008 TREASURE HUNT SERIES 2005 FORD MUSTANG GT FASTER THAN EVER</td><td>PLEASE REQUEST COMBINED SHIPPING BEFORE YOU PAY.

On the average, a single 1/64th scale car costs a minimum of $9.50 to Canada and $14.90 to ship overseas. Multiple items cost more. Shipment tracking is only available by moving up to Express mail. (About double the cost of First Class) International buyers purchase at your own risk with the understanding items are mailed in good faith but cannot be tracked by First Class International mail. 3.) PAYMENT MUST BE MADE BY PAYPAL OR AN E-BAY AUTHORIZED ELECTRONIC PAY SYSTEM. I will insure for $2.10 extra at your request. Delivery confirmation is also available for $1.05. One or both are strongly recommended for buyers protection. (available for U.S. shipments only.). 4.) Winner will be notified by me within 3 days of auction close. PAYMENT WILL BE EXPECTED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF MY WINNERS NOTICE INVOICE DATE to avoid the filing of an EBay payment dispute. I usually ship within 48hrs of payment receipt. 5.) ALL E-BAY RULES APPLY HERE and will be strictly followed. Please see my other auctions, thanks for looking, and good luck in the bidding.</td><td>Toys & Hobbies:Diecast & Toy Vehicles:Cars, Trucks & Vans:Diecast-Modern Manufacture</td><td>2</td><td>0.99</td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/Sf4AAOxycD9TVxjN/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/Sf4AAOxycD9TVxjN/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"  width="350"></td><td><img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/Sf4AAOxycD9TVxjN/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F" width="350"></td></tr><tr><td>397</td><td>121324037940</td><td>HOT WHEELS 1999 #1058 '96 MUSTANG MTFLK BURGUNDY W/ GLDWSP'S MINT ON CARD</td><td>WELCOME TO VINTAGE GLASS & TOYS.

I'm a Camaro collector so I took the Camaro out of the pack & now I have the Mustang available for sale. I tried to save the originally packaged as best as I could but it's obviously not perfect. I just wanted to include it in the sale in case someone wanted it. The car is new & it hasn't ever been out of the package, I just slipped the Camaro out of the bottom. This is a cool piece & it will make a great additional to anyone's Mustang or Hot Wheels collection. Don't let it get away! Please let me know if you have any questions.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS-PLEASE EMAIL ME. ****IMPORTANT**** PLEASE READ INFORMATION BELOW Thank you for visiting my store. I spend a lot of time scouring the country side and city streets searching for just the right treasures. Make sure you check out my store, you never know what treasure you might find there. Payment is appreciated within 72 hours but if you need a little more time(within reason)i am sure that we can work something out. Pay-pal is my preferred payment method. If you need to make arrangements to pay by another method-please email me before bidding or buying. Most of the treasures I sell have been in storage for awhile and may have some dust and dirt associated with such. I do a light cleaning but leave the majority up to you. I have learned that most of my customers prefer it that way. I take many pictures and describe my items honestly and accurately. HOWEVER-I am human and on occasion screw up. If for ANY REASON-after you have inspected your new treasure you do not feel you can leave **5 STAR POSITIVE FEEDBACK** PLEASE email me before leaving ANY FEEDBACK. i promise you that i will make it right. i try to price my treasures fairly and pretty close to what i need to get for each one. HOWEVER-you will notice that there is most always a make offer option. if you have an interest in one of my treasures but feel the price is a little high-send me a REASONABLE offer and i will either accept it or make you a counter offer. Take a few minutes and check out some of my feedbacks. Don't just look at the percentage-read a few. Your satisfaction is VERY important to me. If you are purchasing more than one item-please wait until I send you an invoice before paying. I always combine shipping to save you some $$$$$$$. Your new treasure will be packaged very carefully. However-i will not be held responsible for rough and careless handling by postal employees. ****NOTE TO ALL INTERNATIONAL BUYERS**** USPS NO LONGER OFFERS TRACKING ON 1st CLASS INTERNATIONAL PACKAGES SO IF YOU CHOOSE THAT SERVICE(which is considerably less expensive) I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERY. PRIORITY IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE BUT ALSO MUCH MORE RELIABLE.

A note on shipping costs from Smittys Carz: *The eBay 'Cart' / shipping calculator will not show correct shipping on purchases of multiple items. Our shipping charges are based on packed weight of items, not car count. Priority Mail charges indicated are calculated at the highest "zone" rate - so you may pay less. If you overpay shipping based on eBay shipping calculations - I will refund the difference through Paypal. To get the best shipping price on a multiple item purchase - please request a combined invoice when you are done shopping - before you pay! I also don't mind waiting a few days for payment, if you are still looking at my items. I try to add new items daily and try to respond quickly if you ask for an item that you do not see listed. We combine shipping and ship immediately upon payment! You Pay... We Ship! (Sometimes on the same day!) We accept Paypal. Please email me for other payment options. Payment or payment arrangement must be made within 7 days of auction end date. Nevada residents pay sales tax.

Actual shipping may be less than indicated - request invoice when done shopping! We can usually ship (3-4) HW COOL CLASSICS cars at the Priority Mail rate shown, or less! I will use the most cost effective method to get multiple cars to you, including Priority Regional box and Flat Rate box options when available. Display your cars "loose"?

About Me Hello, thanks for looking at my listing! I am a die-hard car enthusiast that has bought, sold, traded & collected automotive memorabilia items for the better part of 20 years. I am liquidating a large portion of my own collections in the coming weeks & months, including a lot of great vintage automotive advertisements & memorabilia, rare model kits, Hot Wheels diecast cars & collectibles, & even some rare & classic automotive parts. Please email me with any questions & save me to your favorites as there will be lots of good, hard to find, valuable items available! Thanks & good luck! Shipping Items will be shipped via USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail, or Parcel Select Mail depending on what type of item is listed. Some listings may have multiple or all options, it is up to the buyer to choose which shipping method they want at the time of checkout. I will only ship to the confirmed address you have listed with Paypal, if you need the item shipped somewhere else please change your confirmed shipping address prior to making payment. I try to ship items out within a day of receiving a cleared payment, however I do have a career outside of eBay that keeps me very busy, so it might be 2-3 days sometimes before I can ship out your item. The shipping price you see is the actual price it costs me, but in some instances a very slight handling fee will be included to cover some of my packaging costs. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these shipping guidelines. International Bidders Please Read I will ship anywhere in the world, but please be prepared to follow these guidelines before placing your bid. I only ship items internationally via US Postal Service Priority International Mail...no exceptions. Import duties and/or taxes imposed by your country are not included in the price of this item, those will be the buyers responsibility once they arrive in your country. Lastly, once an item has left the country according to the tracking number, it is very difficult to track it & therefore I am not responsible if it gets lost. Let me know if you have any questions. Combined Shipping I am happy to combine items together into one shipment to save you money on multiple purchases. If you would like to know what 2 or more items will cost shipped together, please contact me before you bid & I will give you the combined shipping cost. If you win more than one auction, or plan to bid on another, please contact me before you send payment. I will then send a revised invoice showing the total for the items as well as the combined discounted shipping price. For single Hot Wheels or diecast cars, one axtra car will be .50 extra for 1st Class Mail, for 3-4 cars I will ship via USPS Priority Small Flat Rate box for $6.50, for 5-30 cars I will ship via USPS Priority Medium Flat Rate box for $12.00. Additional purchases must be made within 5 days of the original purchase to qualify for combined shipping. Payment Terms Once the auction has ended, payment in full must be made within 7 days. Once the payment has been received & has cleared, the item will be packaged up with care & sent out within 3 business days at the most. Selling on eBay is a hobby for me, I have a real day job as well so please be patient in my response time as my days are sometimes very busy. Thats about it, let me know if anyone has questions, & be sure to look at my other auctions for some neat hard-to-find items! Thanks for looking, & good luck!

L@@K at photos!! !!!!!!*********************!!!!!!****************************!!!!!*******************************!!!!! What you see in the photo is exactly what you are bidding on. If you are new to EBay, please ask questions and ALWAYS give sellers the opportunity to address any issues you may have (with an item you won from their auction) prior to leaving neutral or negative feedback. Most sellers block new bidders for not being educated on EBay etiquette. We do not want to do that, so let us work with you. COMBINED SHIPPING: Items must be totaled & paid for with one invoice. Once you are done bidding/buying, I will send you an invoice. Otherwise, normal per item shipping and handling charges will apply to each individual item. Also, I make no money on shipping. I charge you what I am charged, if there is a difference, you will most likely receive a refund from me. READ ITEM DESCRIPTIONS CAREFULLY: I describe what I see and what I know about the item based on my information and research. I do not claim to be an expert. You need to be the expert on the items you are bidding on. Ask questions and know that all sales are final. MISC Disclaimers: If you won an item, you must pay for the item.
