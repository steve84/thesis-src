New in the box is accurate and specific. Option A is FAR too wordy without any breakup of the content. My experience would tend to believe most readers would stop reading after about the second line. If I enjoy swimming is unnecessary, but Option B could have mentioned the waterproof component of the watch. Still for straight forward information that is easy to read and interesting, option B gets to the point. Sometimes in Internet advertising more is not always better.",Thanks for the opportunity. ,

A bullet pointed list would be much better.

Option B is too generic a description and doesn't describe important features like water resistance and the clasp.

Option A is only better because it gives more complete information, the wall of text needs to be fixed though.",,
