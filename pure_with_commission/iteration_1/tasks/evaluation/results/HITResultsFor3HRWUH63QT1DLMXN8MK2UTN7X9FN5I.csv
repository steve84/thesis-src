Titles:
Option A has the better title, collectors who would be looking at this will definatly check out something labeled as mint first.

Descriptions:
Option A is just a huge run on sentence and is really hard to read.  It has all the information that should be included, it's just hard to get beyond the first couple of lines.
Option B is better formatted but not informative enough.  At least someone will bother to read it though.

Category:
Option A is the better category.

I chose B because at least people will read it.",,

It is pretty obvious by the box that the character can change. Also a collector that might care that the box is unopened wouldn't open the box to change her outfit. Option B provides enough information for the true gamer to know what he/she is getting.,,
