""Lot of Football Game"" . . . is vague and throws up a red flag in this industry. The option B specifies ""Set of"" . . . and ""Sets"" (assorted or otherwise) are usually more valuable than just a ""Lot of"". 
Option B also specifies that these are ""NFL Jersey cards"". Although these are ""used"", as in ""worn"" jersey fragments I do not believe the word ""used"" is the best choice here.","No problems. Thanks for the opportunity. I frequently delve in similar types of items selling on the Internet, and the above mentioned criteria are relevant when assessing true value of a sports collectible.",

the word Lot gives the searcher of an item(s) such as this an easier way to find it. If I were looking for a set of football cards I would use the word lot to find it.  Also option A suggests it is in perfect condition.  When you are in a hobby such as this the difference between perfect and great could mean a sale.",,

For this kind of collectible it would be beneficial to include exactly which players are on the cards.  At least option A states that it's 13 teams members but doesn't really state how many cards and what players are in the lot.  Since it's only 13 players that should be easy to do and a collector is not going to throw down cash unless they know what they are getting in this case.

Option A is better only for the reason that it states that it includes 13 players, however, both are pretty bad.",,
