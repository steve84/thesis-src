The biggest issue in selling these designer bags are the amount of fakes.  The many women in my life who have purchased bags online are always nervous about receiving a fake, my sister-in-law even got taken by someone who said the bags where real but, they where fakes.  So, it is important to make every effort to make the potential buyer confident in the authenticity of the bag.

Though Option B does slightly go into it's authenticity, it doesn't go far enough and the pictures need to be higher resolution and have better close ups that confirm authenticity.",,

With online options this could result in poor feed back if the seller is not upfront with this information. Option A is at least honest, if not quite as well written as Option B.",,
