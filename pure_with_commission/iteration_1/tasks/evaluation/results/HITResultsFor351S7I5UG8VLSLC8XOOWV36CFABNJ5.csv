One reason I feel this way is the lack of space between "".""'s and the start of a new sentence in Option A.",,

Option A expands on the information slightly more than option B, but does not go overboard with too much information that the reader simply blows on to the next item. The defining point for me was the statement ""good as new"" in option B. This is an opinionated statement and in my experience may indicate something wrong with the item, even if only minor. Also, although I usually do not subscribe to making suggestive overtones to buyers, triggering a buyer's sentimental side by saying ""This phone is a perfect gift"" is subtle and well placed to add appeal in my opinion. Someone might not want the phone for themselves, but this might trigger other thoughts justifying a purchase. ",No problems. Thanks for the opportunities.,

Also, the title for option A is a bit misleading in stating that it is new, when it isn't.  Though it is barely used, it's still used and option B makes that point better.

Overall, option B sounds more trustworthy.

I would say that the option B title with the option A description would be best.",,
