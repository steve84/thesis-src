Great condition, slight signs of handling. In a 1956 cover story in Time magazine, Eero Saarinen said he was designing a collection to "clear up the slum of legs in the U.S. home."

This table is manufactured by Knoll according to the original and exacting specifications of the designer. Made in Italy. Pedestal Tables come in a variety of table top materials (veneer, marble and laminate) and base colors (black, white and platinum).The base has an abrasion-resistant Rilsan finish.Each piece is stamped with the KnollStudio logo and Eero Saarinen's signature.Measurements: Assembled Table H 28.25" Diameter 47" Materials: Cast aluminum base with Rilsan finish; bevel-edged top in laminate Laminate: MDF with laminate.
