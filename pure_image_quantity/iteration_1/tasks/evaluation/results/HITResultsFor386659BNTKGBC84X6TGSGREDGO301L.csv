The pertinent details and features are included: water resistant, for example.  Option B does not mention stopwatch or the light up features.  Option B does have a better category choice, but the description is vague and a bit too ""rah-rah"" kind of showy.  Option A provides the model number.  Describing the different language that the instructions are written in is way too much information in the description--such would be something a bidder would write about to inquire.",,

I do understand the model number is inclusive on a picture but sometimes when you buy something online the model number and the picture or something may differ. When I purchase something it is imperative to have the model number. Something else does not stand out in the photo(s), the paperwork that comes with the watch (instructions, warranty, etc.) is not in the photo in a comprehensive manner","Trying to get too much information in a personal advertisement is not necessary. Option ""B"" is trying too hard. A good shopper will do his or her own research before they purchase the item. That's where the model number comes in handy. Another words option ""B"" is too busy in my opinion",
