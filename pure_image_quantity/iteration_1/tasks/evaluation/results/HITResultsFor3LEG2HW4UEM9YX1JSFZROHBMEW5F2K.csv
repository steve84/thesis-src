Perfect condition!",What draws my attention to this option is the jersey cards and reassurance of the condition of the cars as mint and perfect condition.  I also like that it says these are rare..  Everyone one wants rare cards. The layout of these cards are more eye catching than the other option as well. Option b seems more worried about the payment then enticing me to buy and doesn't describe the cards much at all.,It just took me a min to correlate picture with option.  Overall good task.,
